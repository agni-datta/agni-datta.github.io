    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My research lies in theoretical computer science, focusing on the foundations of cryptography and its
        interface with neighboring areas. I study proof systems and advanced cryptographic primitives, including
        non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and indistinguishability obfuscation. I am also beginning to
        explore quantum-native cryptography.</p>

    <p>Research areas:</p>
